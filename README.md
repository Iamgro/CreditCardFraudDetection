• Resolved class imbalance using oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE and applied feature engineering to extract critical variables.
• Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling with StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler and categorical encoding.
• Leveraged Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers, and imporved performance by optimizing hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
• Conducted model evaluation using key metrics like accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, achieving best accuracy score of 93% on XGBoost.
